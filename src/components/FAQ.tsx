        question: 'How long can I use each number for?',
        answer:
            'Our numbers have a short lifespan of 10-20 minutes, perfectly timed for one-time 2FA code usage. This brief window ensures optimal security while giving you ample time to complete your verification process.\n'
    },{
        question: 'Why didn\'t my 2FA code work?',
        answer: 'There are a few reasons why your 2FA code might not have worked. First, double-check that you have entered the number correctly on the website. A common mistake is including the area code when it is not needed. Also, ensure you are using the code within the valid time window, as most 2FA codes expire quickly. If you are still having trouble, try requesting a new number or contact our support team for assistance.'
